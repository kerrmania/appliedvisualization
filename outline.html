1) What is this magical world that is: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock?
2) Let's make a force-directed graph: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045
  a) Copy code directly into index.html
  b) Copy json directly into miserables.json
  c) Run python -m SimpleHTTPServer
  d) Go to localhost:8000/index.html
  e) It works!
3) But who has json files? Everyone has spreadsheets. Let's edit this visualization to input a csv file.
  a) We start with miserables.csv. Open in Excel and take a look.
  b) We write the csv to original json version conversion.
  b) Then we figure out how to go from a standard Excel format to the one we'd find in miserables (pivot table).
4) Did we just build something that can make a force graph out of ANYTHING?
5) OK fine let's learn a bit about force graphs.
6) Let's try to throw in another dataset!
7) Now we're off with our own data!
