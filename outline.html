1) What is this magical world that is: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock ???

2) Let's make a force-directed graph: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045
  a) Copy code directly into a local force_v1.html
  b) Copy json directly into miserables.json
  c) Run python -m SimpleHTTPServer
  d) Go to localhost:8000/force_v1.html
  e) It works!

3) But who has json files? Everyone has spreadsheets. Let's edit this visualization to input a csv file.
  a) Open miserables.csv in Excel and take a look
  b) Let's convert this csv structure into what our code expects. Console.log() is our friend.
  c) --optional: Then we figure out how to go from a standard Excel format to the one we'd find in miserables (pivot table or grafly).

4) Did we just build the most flexible force graph ever? Let's try with amazing NBA data. Doesn't work! Looks like we do need to learn some d3.
  a) Color: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Ordinal-Scales
  b) Force: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout
  c) Data Binding: http://mbostock.github.io/d3/tutorial/circle.html

5) Now we're off! Let's spend the rest of the time building bl.ocks.org visualizations with our own data. Here are recommended blocks:
  a) Pie Chart: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887235
  b) Bar Chart: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7452541
  c) Line Chart: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3884955
  d) Area With Brushing (fancy): http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1667367
  e) Parallel Coordinates (fancy): http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7586334

6) Next Steps (Go deeper with javascript and d3):
  a) Scott Murray is the man: http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/
  b) d3noob.org is great
  c) Learn from existing frameworks: http://nvd3.org, http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/, http://d3-generator.com/, http://tenxer.github.io/xcharts/
  d) Go wild
